# Fair Face Classification

By: Ricardo Lazo Vasquez

In this project I will classify the Race, Age, and Gender of different people. I will use images of faces with dimentions of 224 x 224 RGB. The Dataset is in this [URL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ghaidaalatoum/fairface). 

## Objectives

Concretely, I want to see if I can classify highly biased races by AIs with a dedicated model designed to classify photos of people of different races, ages and genders.

## Reasons of the approach

I selected the deep learning approach because of the challenge and the naturality of the problem. The desired architecture must be able to classify the photos in multiple independant categories, so a deep learning approach is more reliable to this approach.
